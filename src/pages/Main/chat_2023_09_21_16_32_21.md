1. **You**: upto 1500000

6>=12 ==> 8.70%
12>=18 ==>9.45%
18>=24 ==>10.20%
24>=60 ==>11.20%
After 5 years ==> 12%

more than 1500000 to 3000000
less than 6 months ==> No interest
6>=12 ==> 7.98%
12>=18 ==>8.66%
18>=24 ==>9.35%

Also if someone invest 10000000 then he will get as this
out of 10000000 first 1500000 will be calculated as upto 1500000 and rest of the amount will be calculated as more than 1500000 to 3000000 and so on.

now complete this function
const calculateBondReturns = (amount: number) => {

};

const returns = calculateBondReturns(15000000);
console.log(returns);
